    Parameters
    ----------
    arrays : list of ndarray (time-steps, data-dimensions)
        Arrays of data. Rows in these arrays are assumed to correspond to time
        steps, and columns to variables. Multiple arrays can be given; in such
        a case, these arrays usually correspond to [input, output]---for
        example, for a recurrent regression problem---or [input, output,
        weights]---for a weighted regression or classification problem.
    steps : int, optional
        Generate samples of this many time steps. Defaults to 100.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Generate this many samples per call. Defaults to 64. This must match the
        batch_size parameter that was used when creating the recurrent network
        that will process the data.
    rng : :class:`numpy.random.RandomState` or int, optional
        A random number generator, or an integer seed for a random number
        generator. If not provided, the random number generator will be created
        with an automatically chosen seed.

    Returns
    -------
    callable :
        A callable that can be used inside a dataset for training a recurrent
        network.

        times will be used.
    min_count : int, optional
        If the alphabet is to be computed from the text, discard characters that

class Autoencoder(feedforward.Autoencoder):
    '''An autoencoder network attempts to reproduce its input.

    Examples
    --------

    To create a recurrent autoencoder, just create a new model instance. Often
    you'll provide the layer configuration at this time:

    >>> model = theanets.recurrent.Autoencoder([10, (20, 'rnn'), 10])

    See :ref:`guide-creating` for more information.

    *Data*

    Training data for a recurrent autoencoder takes the form of a
    three-dimensional array. The shape of this array is (num-examples,
    num-time-steps, num-variables): the first axis enumerates data points in a
    batch, the second enumerates time steps, and the third enumerates the
    variables in the model.

    For instance, to create a training dataset containing 1000 examples, each
    with 100 time steps:

    >>> inputs = np.random.randn(1000, 100, 10).astype('f')

    *Training*

    Training the model can be as simple as calling the :func:`train()
    <theanets.graph.Network.train>` method:

    >>> model.train([inputs])

    See :ref:`guide-training` for more information.

    *Use*

    A model can be used to :func:`predict() <theanets.graph.Network.predict>`
    the output of some input data points:

    >>> test = np.random.randn(3, 200, 10).astype('f')
    >>> print(model.predict(test))

    Note that the test data does not need to have the same number of time steps
    as the training data.

    Additionally, autoencoders can :func:`encode()
    <theanets.feedforward.Autoencoder.encode>` a set of input data points:

    >>> enc = model.encode(test)

    See :ref:`guide-using` for more information.

    Notes
    -----

    Autoencoder models default to a :class:`MSE
    <theanets.losses.MeanSquaredError>` loss. To use a different loss, provide a
    non-default argument for the ``loss`` keyword argument when constructing
    your model.

class Regressor(feedforward.Regressor):
    '''A regressor attempts to produce a target output given some inputs.

    Examples
    --------

    To create a recurrent regression model, just create a new class instance.
    Often you'll provide the layer configuration at this time:

    >>> model = theanets.recurrent.Regressor([10, (20, 'rnn'), 3])

    See :ref:`guide-creating` for more information.

    *Data*

    Training data for a recurrent regression model takes the form of two
    three-dimensional arrays. The shapes of these arrays are (num-examples,
    num-time-steps, num-variables): the first axis enumerates data points in a
    batch, the second enumerates time steps, and the third enumerates the
    variables (input variables for the input array, and output variables for the
    output array) in the model.

    For instance, to create a training dataset containing 1000 examples, each
    with 100 time steps:

    >>> inputs = np.random.randn(1000, 100, 10).astype('f')
    >>> outputs = np.random.randn(1000, 100, 3).astype('f')

    *Training*

    Training the model can be as simple as calling the :func:`train()
    <theanets.graph.Network.train>` method:

    >>> model.train([inputs, outputs])

    See :ref:`guide-training` for more information.

    *Use*

    A model can be used to :func:`predict() <theanets.graph.Network.predict>`
    the output of some input data points:

    >>> test = np.random.randn(3, 200, 10).astype('f')
    >>> print(model.predict(test))

    Note that the test data does not need to have the same number of time steps
    as the training data.

    See :ref:`guide-using` for more information.

    Regressor models default to a :class:`MSE
    <theanets.losses.MeanSquaredError>` loss. To use a different loss, provide a

class Classifier(feedforward.Classifier):
    '''A classifier computes a distribution over labels, given an input.

    Examples
    --------

    To create a recurrent classification model, just create a new class
    instance. Often you'll provide the layer configuration at this time:

    >>> model = theanets.recurrent.Classifier([10, (20, 'rnn'), 50])

    See :ref:`guide-creating` for more information.

    *Data*

    Training data for a recurrent classification model takes the form of two
    three-dimensional arrays.

    The first array provides the input data for the model. Its shape is
    (num-examples, num-time-steps, num-variables): the first axis enumerates
    data points in a batch, the second enumerates time steps, and the third
    enumerates the input variables in the model.

    The second array provides the target class labels for the inputs. Its shape
    is (num-examples, num-time-steps), and each integer value in the array gives
    the class label for the corresponding input example and time step.

    For instance, to create a training dataset containing 1000 examples, each
    with 100 time steps:

    >>> inputs = np.random.randn(1000, 100, 10).astype('f')
    >>> outputs = np.random.randint(50, size=(1000, 100)).astype('i')

    *Training*

    Training the model can be as simple as calling the :func:`train()
    <theanets.graph.Network.train>` method:

    >>> model.train([inputs, outputs])

    See :ref:`guide-training` for more information.

    *Use*

    A model can be used to :func:`predict() <theanets.graph.Network.predict>`
    the output of some input data points:

    >>> test = np.random.randn(3, 200, 10).astype('f')
    >>> print(model.predict(test))

    This method returns a two-dimensional array containing the most likely class
    for each input example and time step.

    Note that the test data does not need to have the same number of time steps
    as the training data.

    To retrieve the probabilities of the classes for each example, use
    :func:`predict_proba() <theanets.feedforward.Classifier.predict_proba>`:

    >>> model.predict_proba(test).shape
    (3, 100, 50)

    Recurrent classifiers have a :func:`predict_sequence` helper method that
    predicts values in an ongoing sequence. Given a seed value, the model
    predicts one time step ahead, then adds the prediction to the seed, predicts
    one more step ahead, and so on:

    >>> seed = np.random.randint(50, size=10).astype('i')
    >>> print(model.predict_sequence(seed, 100))

    See :class:`Text` for more utility code that is helpful for working with
    sequences of class labels.

    See also :ref:`guide-using` for more information.

    Notes
    -----

    Classifier models default to a :class:`cross-entropy
    <theanets.losses.CrossEntropy>` loss. To use a different loss, provide a
    non-default argument for the ``loss`` keyword argument when constructing
    your model.
