"""
Pretrained models imported from external repositories.

For faster loading in worker nodes, use a shared space for head node and workers
to access pretrained weights by setting the environment variable TORCH_HOME.
Preload the weights on head node when running for the first time.

Example:
export TORCH_HOME=/mnt/efs/results/torch

In Python console:
from nupic.research.frameworks.pytorch.models import <model name>
<model name>()

Note:
- models larger than Resnet50 will not fit the GPU with the regular batch size
- if SSL certificate error, run in python console prior to downloading models:
  import ssl; ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

    Regular Resnet50 network trained in semi-weakly supervised fashion.

    "Semi-weakly" supervised (SWSL) ImageNet models are pre-trained on 940 million
    public images with 1.5K hashtags matching with 1000 ImageNet1K synsets, followed
    by fine-tuning on ImageNet1K dataset. In this case, the associated hashtags are
    only used for building a better teacher model.

    During training the student model, those hashtags are ingored and the student model
    is pretrained with a subset of 64M images selected by the teacher model from the
    same 940 million public image dataset.
