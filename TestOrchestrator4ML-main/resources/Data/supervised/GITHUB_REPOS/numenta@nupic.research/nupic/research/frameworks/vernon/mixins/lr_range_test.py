    On usage: Make sure that the `required_mixins` are included in your experiment_class
              See `create_lr_test_experiment` to automate this.

    Herein, a min_lr and max_lr are set, and training proceeds for a small number of
    epochs (1-3) while the learning rate is linearly increased. Generally, the point
    at which the training loss begins to curve upwards and increases while the
    validation/test loss still decreases, is considered to be a reasonable choice
    for your max_lr in a cyclical lr-schedule. The same author recommends using 10-20
    times lower this amount for your min_lr.
