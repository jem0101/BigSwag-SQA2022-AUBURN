    This logs its arguments to wandb only if a run has been initialized.

    It's intended for use in conjunction with the `WorkerLogger` mixin which initializes
    wandb on a specified set of workers. Generally, the ray based logger, `WandbLogger`,
    is intended to log results on the head node, while this function (and the helper
    mixin) serve to log other values on the worker nodes - for instance, grad norms of
    pytroch modules.

    Example:
    ```
    plt = plot(...)
    log({"accuracy": 0.9, "epoch": 5, "my_plot": plt})
    ```

    See `wandb.log` usage for details:
        - https://docs.wandb.com/library/log
        - https://docs.wandb.com/library/log#incremental-logging

    Note: `commit` defaults to False here instead of True. This means the call to
          `wandb.log` will not advance the step count. See the link on incremental
          logging.

    :param row: A dict of serializable python objects i.e str: ints, floats, Tensors,
                dicts, or wandb.data_types
    :param commit: Persist a set of metrics, if false just update the existing dict
                   (defaults to true if step is not specified)
    :param step: The global step in processing. This persists any non-committed earlier
                 steps but defaults to not committing the specified step
    :param sync: If set to False, process calls to log in a separate thread

    This forks the wandb 0.9.7 ray WandbLogger to
        1) make resuming experiments easier
        2) include more supported data types
        3) support logging time-series formatted results

    As a `ray.tune.logger.Logger` this class will process all results returned from
    training and automatically sync them to wandb.

    To use this class, include it in your `tune.run` config under `loggers` and add
    `env_config["wandb"]` to specify wandb params.

    The main options include
        wandb:
            - name: Chosen name of run/experiment
            - project: Name of wandb project to group all related runs
            - group: Extra layer of naming to group runs under a project
            - notes: A multi-line string associated with the run

    All are optional, but name, project, and notes are recommended. For all wandb init
    params, see https://docs.wandb.com/library/init.

    Example usage:
    ```
    # Be sure to set `WANDB_API_KEY` in environment variables.
    from ray.tune.logger import DEFAULT_LOGGERS
    tune.run(
        MyTrianable,

            }
        }
    )
    ```

    The "result_to_time_series_fn" is a function that takes a result and config
    and returns a dictionary of {timestep: result}. If you provide this
    function, you convert from an epoch-based time series to your own
    timestep-based time series, logging multiple timesteps for each epoch.

               gets called outside of the ray process, the latter typically does not.
