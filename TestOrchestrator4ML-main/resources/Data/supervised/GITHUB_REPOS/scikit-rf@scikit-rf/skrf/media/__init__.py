========================================
media (:mod:`skrf.media`)
========================================

This package provides objects representing transmission line mediums.

The :class:`~media.Media` object is the base-class that is inherited
by specific transmission line instances, such as
:class:`~freespace.Freespace`, or
:class:`~rectangularWaveguide.RectangularWaveguide`. The
:class:`~media.Media` object provides generic methods to produce
:class:`~skrf.network.Network`'s for any transmission line medium, such
as :func:`~media.Media.line` and :func:`~media.Media.delay_short`. These
methods are inherited by the specific transmission line classes,
which interally define relevant quantities such as propagation constant (`gamma`),
and characteristic impedance (`Z0`). This allows the specific transmission line
mediums to produce networks without re-implementing methods for
each specific media instance.
