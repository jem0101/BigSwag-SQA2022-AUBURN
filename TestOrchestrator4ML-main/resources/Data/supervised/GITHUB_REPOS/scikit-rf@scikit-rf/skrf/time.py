    Finds the numeric index of the peaks in *y* by taking its first order difference. By using
    *thres* and *min_dist* parameters, it is possible to reduce the number of
    detected peaks. *y* must be signed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : ndarray (signed)
        1D amplitude data to search for peaks.
    thres : float between [0., 1.]
        Normalized threshold. Only the peaks with amplitude higher than the
        threshold will be detected.
    min_dist : int
        Minimum distance between each detected peak. The peak with the highest
        amplitude is preferred to satisfy this constraint.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Array containing the numeric indexes of the peaks that were detected

    Time-gate one-port s-parameters.
    
    The gate can be defined with start/stop times, or by 
    center/span. all times are in units of nanoseconds. common 
    windows are:
     * ('kaiser', 6)
     * 6 # integers are interpreted as kaiser beta-values
     * 'hamming'
     * 'boxcar'  # a staightup rect
     
    If no parameters are passed this will try to auto-gate the largest
    peak. 

    Parameters
    ------------
    start : number, or None
        start of time gate, (ns). 
    stop : number, or None
        stop of time gate (ns). 
    center : number, or None
        center of time gate, (ns). If None, and span is given, 
        the gate will be centered on the peak.
    span : number, or None
        span of time gate, (ns).  If None span will be half of the 
        distance to the second tallest peak
    mode: ['bandpass','bandstop']
        mode of gate 
    boundary:  {'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'},
        passed to `scipy.ndimage.filters.convolve1d`
    window : string, float, or tuple 
        passed to `window` arg of `scipy.signal.get_window`
    
    Notes
    ------
    You cant gate things that are 'behind' strong reflections. This 
    is due to the multiple reflections that occur. 
    
    If `center!=0`, then the ntwk's time response is shifted 
    to t=0, gated, then shifted back to where it was. This is 
    done in frequency domain using `ntwk.delay()`. If the media being
    gated is dispersive (ie waveguide), then the gate `span` will be 
    span at t=0, which is different.
    
    If you need to time-gate an N-port network, then you should 
    gate each s-parameter independently. 
    
    Returns
    --------
    ntwk : Network
        copy of ntwk with time-gated s-parameters

    .. warning::
        Depending on sharpness of the gate, the  band edges may be 
        inaccurate, due to properties of FFT. We do not re-normalize
        anything.
