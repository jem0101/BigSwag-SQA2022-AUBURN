    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : iterator
        An iterable object (a numpy array is also iterable) or list of iterable objects to grab batches from.
    batch_size : int, optional
        The number of examples to pull from the iterable as a batch. Default is 1.
    min_batch_size : int, optional
        The minimum number of examples to pull from the iterable. Default is 1.

    ------
