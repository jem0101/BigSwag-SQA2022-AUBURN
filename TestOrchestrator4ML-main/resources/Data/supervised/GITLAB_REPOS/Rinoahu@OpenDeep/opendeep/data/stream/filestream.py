    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or iterable(str)
        The filesystem path to stream, or an iterable of filenames.
    filter : str or compiled regex, optional
        The regex filter to apply to the `path` when finding files.
    preprocess : function, optional

    n_future : int, optional
        The number of tokens to start in the future (from the beginning of the first file). This is used often
        when creating language models and you want the targets stream to start 1 or more tokens in the future
        compared to the inputs stream.
