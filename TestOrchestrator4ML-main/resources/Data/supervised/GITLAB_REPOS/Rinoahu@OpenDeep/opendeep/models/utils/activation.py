        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : tuple(shape, `Theano.TensorType`)
            tuple(shape, `Theano.TensorType`) describing the inputs to use for this layer.
            `shape` will be a monad tuple representing known sizes for each dimension in the `Theano.TensorType`.
            The length of `shape` should be equal to number of dimensions in `Theano.TensorType`, where the shape
            element is an integer representing the size for its dimension, or None if the shape isn't known.
            For example, if you have a matrix with unknown batch size but fixed feature size of 784, `shape` would
            be: (None, 784). The full form of `inputs` would be:
            [((None, 784), <TensorType(float32, matrix)>)].
        activation : str or callable
            The activation function to use going from input -> output. This can be a string
            representing an option from `opendeep.utils.activation`, or your own function as long as it is callable.
        **kwargs : keyword args
            Any keyword arguments for the activation function (see `opendeep.utils.activation`).
