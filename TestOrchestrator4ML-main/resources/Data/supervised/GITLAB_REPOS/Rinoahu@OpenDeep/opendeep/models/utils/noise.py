        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : tuple(shape, `Theano.TensorType`)
            tuple(shape, `Theano.TensorType`) describing the inputs to use for this layer.
            `shape` will be a monad tuple representing known sizes for each dimension in the `Theano.TensorType`.
            The length of `shape` should be equal to number of dimensions in `Theano.TensorType`, where the shape
            element is an integer representing the size for its dimension, or None if the shape isn't known.
            For example, if you have a matrix with unknown batch size but fixed feature size of 784, `shape` would
            be: (None, 784). The full form of `inputs` would be:
            [((None, 784), <TensorType(float32, matrix)>)].
        noise : str
            What type of noise to use for the output. See opendeep.utils.noise
            for options. This should be appropriate for the unit activation, i.e. Gaussian for tanh or other
            real-valued activations, etc.
        noise_level : float
            The amount of noise to use for the noise function specified by `noise`. This could be the
            standard deviation for gaussian noise, the interval for uniform noise, the dropout amount, etc.
        noise_decay : str or False
            Whether to use `noise` scheduling (decay `noise_level` during the course of training),
            and if so, the string input specifies what type of decay to use. See opendeep.utils.decay for options.
            Noise decay (known as noise scheduling) effectively helps the model learn larger variance features first,
            and then smaller ones later (almost as a kind of curriculum learning). May help it converge faster.
        noise_decay_amount : float
            The amount to reduce the `noise_level` after each training epoch based on the decay function specified
            in `noise_decay`.
        mrg : random
            A random number generator that is used when adding noise.
            I recommend using Theano's sandbox.rng_mrg.MRG_RandomStreams.
        switch : boolean
            Whether to create a switch to turn noise on during training and off during testing (True). If False,
            noise will be applied at both training and testing times.
