    From Pylearn2 (https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2/blob/master/pylearn2/training_algorithms/learning_rule.py)

    The RMSProp learning rule is described by Hinton in `lecture 6
    <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf>`
    of the Coursera Neural Networks for Machine Learning course.
    In short, Hinton suggests "[the] magnitude of the gradient can be very
    different for different weights and can change during learning. This
    makes it hard to choose a global learning rate." RMSProp solves this
    problem by "[dividing] the learning rate for a weight by a running
    average of the magnitudes of recent gradients for that weight."

        Initialize RMSProp.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset : Dataset
            The :class:`opendeep.data.Dataset` to use when training the Model.
        loss : Loss
            The :class:`opendeep.optimization.loss.Loss` function to compare the model to a 'target' result.
        model : Model
            The :class:`opendeep.models.Model` to train. Needed if the Optimizer isn't being passed to a
            Model's .train() method.
        epochs : int
            how many training iterations over the dataset to go.
        batch_size : int
            How many examples from the training dataset to use in parallel.
        min_batch_size : int
            The minimum number of examples required at a time (for things like time series, this would be > 1).
        save_freq : int
            How many epochs to train between each new save of the Model's parameters.
        stop_threshold : float
            The factor by how much the best validation training score needs to improve to determine early stopping.
        stop_patience : int
            The patience or number of epochs to wait after the stop_threshold has been reached before stopping.
        learning_rate : float
            The multiplicative amount to adjust parameters based on their gradient values.
        lr_decay : str
            The type of decay function to use for changing the learning rate over epochs. See
            `opendeep.utils.decay` for options.
        lr_decay_factor : float
            The amount to use for the decay function when changing the learning rate over epochs. See
            `opendeep.utils.decay` for its effect for given decay functions.
        decay : float, optional
            Decay constant similar to that used in AdaDelta and Momentum methods.
        max_scaling: float, optional
            Restrict the RMSProp gradient scaling coefficient to values
            below `max_scaling`.
        grad_clip : float, optional
            Whether to clip gradients. This will clip with a maximum of grad_clip or the parameter norm.
        hard_clip : bool
            Whether to use a hard cutoff or rescaling for clipping gradients.

        Provides the symbolic (theano) description of the updates needed to

        Parameters
        ----------
        gradients : dict
            A dictionary mapping from the model's parameters to their
            gradients.

        Returns
        -------
        updates : OrderdDict
            A dictionary mapping from the old model parameters, to their new

        Notes
        -----
        This method has the side effect of storing the moving average
        of the square gradient in `self.mean_square_grads`. This is
        necessary in order for the monitoring channels to be able
        to track the value of these moving averages.
        Therefore, this method should only get called once for each
        instance of RMSProp.
