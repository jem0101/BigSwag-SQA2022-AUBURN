class NeighborSampler(NodeFlowSampler):
    '''Create a sampler that samples neighborhood.

    It returns a generator of :class:`~dgl.NodeFlow`. This can be viewed as
    an analogy of *mini-batch training* on graph data -- the given graph represents
    the whole dataset and the returned generator produces mini-batches (in the form
    of :class:`~dgl.NodeFlow` objects).
    
    A NodeFlow grows from sampled nodes. It first samples a set of nodes from the given
    ``seed_nodes`` (or all the nodes if not given), then samples their neighbors
    and extracts the subgraph. If the number of hops is :math:`k(>1)`, the process is repeated
    recursively, with the neighbor nodes just sampled become the new seed nodes.
    The result is a graph we defined as :class:`~dgl.NodeFlow` that contains :math:`k+1`
    layers. The last layer is the initial seed nodes. The sampled neighbor nodes in
    layer :math:`i+1` are in layer :math:`i`. All the edges are from nodes
    in layer :math:`i` to layer :math:`i+1`.

    TODO(minjie): give a figure here.
    
    As an analogy to mini-batch training, the ``batch_size`` here is equal to the number
    of the initial seed nodes (number of nodes in the last layer).
    The number of nodeflow objects (the number of batches) is calculated by
    ``len(seed_nodes) // batch_size`` (if ``seed_nodes`` is None, then it is equal
    to the set of all nodes in the graph).

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : DGLGraph
        The DGLGraph where we sample NodeFlows.
    batch_size : int
        The batch size (i.e, the number of nodes in the last layer)
    expand_factor : int, float, str
        The number of neighbors sampled from the neighbor list of a vertex.
        The value of this parameter can be:

        * int: indicates the number of neighbors sampled from a neighbor list.
        * float: indicates the ratio of the sampled neighbors in a neighbor list.
        * str: indicates some common ways of calculating the number of sampled neighbors,
          e.g., ``sqrt(deg)``.

        Note that no matter how large the expand_factor, the max number of sampled neighbors
        is the neighborhood size.
    num_hops : int, optional
        The number of hops to sample (i.e, the number of layers in the NodeFlow).
        Default: 1
    neighbor_type: str, optional
        Indicates the neighbors on different types of edges.

        * "in": the neighbors on the in-edges.
        * "out": the neighbors on the out-edges.
        * "both": the neighbors on both types of edges.

        Default: "in"
    node_prob : Tensor, optional
        A 1D tensor for the probability that a neighbor node is sampled.
        None means uniform sampling. Otherwise, the number of elements
        should be equal to the number of vertices in the graph.
        Default: None
    seed_nodes : Tensor, optional
        A 1D tensor  list of nodes where we sample NodeFlows from.
        If None, the seed vertices are all the vertices in the graph.
        Default: None
    shuffle : bool, optional
        Indicates the sampled NodeFlows are shuffled. Default: False
    num_workers : int, optional
        The number of worker threads that sample NodeFlows in parallel. Default: 1
    prefetch : bool, optional
        If true, prefetch the samples in the next batch. Default: False
    add_self_loop : bool, optional
        If true, add self loop to the sampled NodeFlow.
        The edge IDs of the self loop edges are -1. Default: False
